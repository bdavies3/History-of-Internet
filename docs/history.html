    <p>We’ve heard the Internet being described in broad, dramatic language: likening it to the man’s harnessing of fire or invention of the wheel. Though it feels like it’s only been around for two decades, the degree to which it has permeated all aspects of our life cannot be understated, and this series seeks to trace back the roots of this technology, just how it came to be, and where it’s headed. Here, we seek to examine the Internet from all angles: as the world’s largest marketplace, its largest repository of knowledge and forum for discussion, and its use as a tool in everything from diplomacy to warfare. </p>
    <br>
    <p>It’s fitting then, that the story of the Internet begins with government funded research in the 1950’s, in an era where a single computer might take up an entire room and the idea of a world wide web bringing all of them together was beyond even the wildest science fiction of the day. The launch of Sputnik in 1957 spurred the Eisenhower administration into action, determined to showcase not only America’s military might, but its scientific (and eventually space-faring) ambitions as well, forming ARPA, the Advanced Research Projects Agency. However, following the creation of NASA to spearhead the space race, ARPA was relegated to projects concerning computer science, and fell into obscurity. </p>
    <br>
    <p>In the 60’s, fearing a total loss of communication in the event of a nuclear strike, the government appointed Dr. Paul Baran to investigate other forms of communication without the same vulnerabilities as phone lines. He and his team envisioned a network driven by “hot potato routing”, where a message transmitted by the sender would still reach its intended recipient even if part the network was down by seeking an alternate route. To accomplish this, the message was divided into small, equally sized collections of data called packets with a “to” and “from” address, using their own independent paths to reach their destination, where they would reassemble. Packets would pass through predetermined nodes, which would keep copies of said packets until they were received successfully. By having a system of many different nodes all in contact with each other, it allowed for a degree of flexibility should one or multiple nodes fail. </p>
    <br>
    <p>In 1969, the next big breakthrough came in the form of what was called “time sharing”, to allow two different computers to talk to one another without constantly having to switch terminals, by putting them all on the same network. Experiments regarding this technology had already been underway, but there remained the problem of how to connect these computers without specifically programming each one to connect to another specific computer. The idea was proposed to build separate “mini computers” and tie those together in a network, so the computer only had to learn how to communicate with that middleman. And so, the server was born, and with it, ARPANET, the seed of what would one day become the Internet, linking 18 computers together by 1971.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another ARPANET breakthrough would be the invention of email, developed alongside the project by Raymond Tomlinson as a file transfer program, and would become indispensable. Inclusion was something that the pioneers of the program held in mind, developing it with an open architecture that as we see today, no single entity can control, and anyone can contribute to. With the development of TCP/IP Protocols in the 70s, local area and wide area networks were now able to “speak” to each other fluently, establishing a large scale network of interconnected networks through gateways. At this point, its use was still restricted to universities and other government funded research institutions, but that would change in 1992, when Congress signed a bill that would turn the Internet loose, and bring it into the homes of the average citizen. A researcher at CERN, Tim Berners-Lee, then developed the World Wide Web, the software that would allow those people to more easily access what the Internet had to offer from their terminal. Combined with the advent of the Internet browser, all that potential could now be harnessed and more easily understood.</p>
