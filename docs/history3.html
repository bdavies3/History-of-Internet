  <p>In our current era, it’s difficult to think of our Internet vocabulary without one important verb: Google. As synonymous as Microsoft was with the computing world in the 90’s, and remains today, Netscape was by no means the last competitor to challenge the giant. Web pages in those days were flat, crude lists of links with no clear way to get at the topics one sought in the instantaneous manner we think of today. As the Browser Wars ended and the Internet faced the new millennium, consumers now had a way to digest the content available online, but finding information on said topics was still a hurdle that early startups attempted to clear. Much like Mosaic (and by proxy, Netscape), Yahoo was the brainchild of two undergrads, Jerry Yang and David Filo, putting together a project in their off time, and setting their creation loose on the Web to extraordinary results. Still, like Mosaic, they faced yet another hurdle in the form of how to monetize their invention, as the world of ubiquitous e-commerce was still on the horizon.</p>
  <br>
  <p>First came the debate over advertising, as the venture capital firms who funded them believed that the internet, even as a new frontier, would be supported by the same form of ads found in other media. While the founders were reticent to implement ads as they believed it went against the spirit of the then nascent Internet, and for fear of alienating their audience, they eventually relented. However, the onset of banner ads did nothing to stop the swell of users to the platform, drawing more and more commercial interests to the idea. In 1996, Yahoo faced their first competitor in the form of Excite, trading lists and pages organized by human hands for a fully automated approach, that scoured the web for pages containing search terms, thus building a rudimentary form of what we now think of as the search engine.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This led to a veritable arms race in terms of features: email, stock tickers, personalization, and a litany of distractions that sites used in order to create a captive audience and keep users on their portals instead of the competition. In this new digital gold rush, the actual search function of the search engines fell by the wayside, leaving users frustrated when their searches took them to ads trying to sell them something instead of what they were actually looking for. Enter Google, yet another product of two students from Stanford, Larry Page and Sergei Brin, who saw what was happening to the Web, and sought a simpler alternative. They built upon the hypothesis that the more often a page was linked to, the more popular, and thus relevant it was. By interpreting the amount of links as endorsements of a page’s usefulness, Page and Brin developed the backbone of what would become Google’s search engine. Resisting early buyout offers from Yahoo’s biggest rival, Excite, the pair approached one of their professors, an angel investor himself, who put them in contact with another well-known entrepreneur who would help them establish their company, gaining the attention of other Silicon Valley investment firms.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In 1998, Google was founded, its sparse and utilitarian layout instantly iconic, both in keeping with Page and Brin’s philosophy against intrusive ads and making sure load times for pages were as quick and snappy as possible. Not entirely against ads, and seeking a way to monetize their creation, the pair looked to Bill Gross of IdeaLab, who theorized that by analyzing the keywords of all the individual users on a platform, one could build a picture of them as a consumer and sell that data to advertisers. Gross would go on to create Overture, a sort of digital version of the yellow pages where advertisers could pay for placement in their search results demonstrating the value of the Internet as the dominant market research tool of the 21st century. Google took that idea and created AdWords, their own spin on the concept, and settled with Gross out of court for an undisclosed sum when he inevitably sued. </p>
  <br>
  <p>The main difference between AdWords and Gross’ model was the clearly marked separation of ads and “pure” search results, which can still be seen today. Thus, the internet advertising boom was in full swing, allowing anyone with the means to find an audience for their product. The rest, as they say, is history, as Google established its dominance of and cultural metonymy with the Internet that would last well into the 2010’s and beyond. </p>
