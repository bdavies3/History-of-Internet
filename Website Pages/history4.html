  <p>Google’s success story was one for the ages, but for every story of start up success, there were hundreds of other ventures that failed to make it out of the digital gold rush of the 1990’s. While Page and Brin struggled with the idea of how to best monetize their creation, the decade would produce two titans of e-commerce that revolutionized online shopping, one looming large over all the rest. In 1995, a Wall Street professional turned tech entrepreneur named Jeff Bezos launched Amazon.com, a site designed primarily to sell books. That same year, Pierre Omidyar, a software engineer, launched the online service Auction Web, later renamed to Ebay, to enable the direct person to person transaction of collectibles. Both men saw almost immediate success, and heralded the age of the Dot Com Boom.</p>
  <br>
  <p>As with any exciting new technology, the success of early startups had investors in a frenzy, leading to a bubble of speculation that proved to be wildly lucrative for some, and disastrous for others. Forgoing slow and steady growth, Bezos pursued a policy of aggressive expansion, slashing prices and thus forgoing profits whenever possible in order to attract as many users to the platform as possible, embodied by the philosophy of “Get Big Fast”. One major milestone in the development of e-commerce was the development of public key cryptography, which enabled encrypted communication between two online parties who had previously never met. Ebay, on the other hand, struggled to shake its image as a flash in the pan success that traded mainly in collectibles and knick knacks that no one wanted. Still, when the company went public in 1998, its stock price soared 168% in its first day. When Amazon followed suit, their stock price doubled within a few weeks of their debut.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The democratization of e-commerce also led to the rise of day trading, where prospective traders could analyze, purchase, and sell from the comfort of their own homes, leading to a new era where financial literacy and investment options were made readily available to the average consumer online. Now more than ever, Silicon Valley was the place to be, with investors rushing to find the next runaway success, and companies threw lavish parties to celebrate their success. Anecdotally, an online ticketing site based in San Francisco celebrated changing its name with a party in an airplane hangar for 3,000 people. Another company celebrated their launch by spending $10 million on a launch party at which the Who performed. Costly ad campaigns, including Superbowl TV spots, averaged around $2.2 million for 30 seconds of screen time. In such charged times, many sites sprang up with little more than a catchy domain name and little to no business ethos to continue that growth, profiting off the rising tide that raised all ships in the Dot Come Boom. The investors and hedge funds who put up the capital for these ventures knew from the start that the vast majority of them were doomed, but it was worth it to bet a few million dollars here and there on the chance that one of them might be the next big thing.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Of course, none of this would be possible without infrastructure, and as the demand for and investment in the Internet grew, so too did the telecommunications companies that made access to the Internet a reality. The development and proliferation of fiber optic cables allowed for faster internet speeds that were able to meet the needs of an increasingly online society. By 1999, the number of Internet sites with IPOs had grown from 20 to over 250, with clear winners like Ebay and Amazon only getting richer. At the turn of the millennium, Jeff Bezos was named TIME Magazine’s Man of the Year, as the icon of e-commerce for decades to come.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In early 2000, while the Federal Reserve sought to raise interest rates in order to curb what they saw as uncontrollable growth, Wall Street also turned a keener eye on their Silicon Valley prospects, as the holiday season had failed to produce the profits they were promised. Companies that had spent millions of dollars on their sites had databases tracking sales in the dozens, setting up a house of cards that was doomed to fall. That year in April, on what would come to be known as “Black Friday”, the Nasdaq dropped 388 points. It was, at that point, the single greatest collapse in the history of the stock market. Eighteen months later, 9/11 would bring a definitive end to the explosive internet economy that America, and indeed the world, had enjoyed for the latter half of the 90’s. Following the crash of hundreds of companies and their stock, then NY Attorney General Elliot Spitzer launched an investigation into Wall Street and the mechanisms that allowed this bubble to occur. With the collapse of the Dot Com Bubble, some 3.3 trillion dollars of paper wealth seemingly disappeared overnight, serving as a cautionary tale for investors and developers alike that even cyberspace was not safe from real world overspeculation. And out of that temporary insanity, came the rise of e-commerce that dominates the world today, and the infrastructure that makes it all possible.</p>
