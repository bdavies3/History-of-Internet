  <p>In this series, we’ve seen how the Internet began as a tool for researchers and academics, then exploded in popularity once the people involved in its development figured out how to make the experience more accessible to the average person, leading to today, where a person’s palm sized, touch screen phone has more computing power than the lander that put a man on the moon. It’s a story that’s still being written, as social media, privacy, and other issues are pushed to the forefront of minds, but we can point to the Internet as a place where the tools of creation and dissemination are put in the hands of more people than ever before in history. The old ways of communication have shifted by degrees and capitulated to a generation that wants its shopping, news, entertainment, and just about everything else online, all the time, at the press of a button. The groundwork for this digital revolution was laid at the beginning of the new millennium, where after the World Wide Web shocked the world, the world changed the Web in turn.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Youtube was founded in 2005 by three University of Illinois students initially as a sort of online dating service, but quickly changed to accept any kind of video upload. In contrast to television, which had set schedules and restrictions and daunting costs as barriers to entry, Youtube had effectively none, only limited by a user’s creativity and internet connection. From it, the viral sensation was born, bringing a subculture that dwelled in message boards and forums to mainstream conversation, and raising a generation of kids savvy in how to navigate this Wild West of information and stimuli. By July of 2006, the site was receiving 100 million views and 65,000 new uploads daily, and later that year would be acquired by Google for $1.6 billion dollars.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This new wave of Web 2.0 startups saw their own booms and busts, as news aggregate site Digg, which receives a fair amount of coverage in this video, would go on to find itself supplanted by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit as the way that the internet receives its news. it goes to show that the landscape of the internet is ever changing, and nothing is set in stone for such an unpredictable environment that no one entity has total control over. Still, in that time, the idea that the people could decide what was important as opposed to the editor of a print newspaper or magazine was a new one, and paved the way for the new media we have today.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Next up was Facebook, and while much has been said about Mark Zuckerberg and his social network, up to and including a Oscar-winning film, it’s hard to imagine a world now where we weren’t all connected by friend requests and follows. While sites like Myspace were a dime a dozen, the pages they displayed were often crude and patchwork, more the domain of schoolkids goofing off in their spare time than anything else, led by a devil may care ethos that characterized much of early 00s start up culture, and the first generation of kids to truly grow up with the Internet as an easy accessible and ubiquitous part of life. Zuckerberg’s take on the idea was more collegiate, aiming to set up a dating site between fellow students on the Harvard campus, but quickly ballooned into a cleaner, more professional alternative to the litany of other sites out there, becoming the dominant force in connecting people online, one friend at a time.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Computers were in classrooms and homes, and being taught from a young age as part of the curriculum, fostering a familiarity with technology that advances with each successive generation. The dominant force of pop culture shifted gears from the airwaves to online, with likes, views, and follows starting to matter just as much if not more than traditional metrics of ratings. Though the terms “influencer” and “content creator” would not enter common parlance until a decade later, there were already channels and personalities building large followings at this time which proved that audiences responded to these underdog stories, and that from the internet or otherwise, anyone could have the makings of a star. It’s fitting then, that in six short years, TIME’s Person of the Year had gone from Bezos, now a billionaire who was conquering e-commerce with a smiling logo, to You, the reader, and all of us, for demonstrating the power and the reach of the social aspect of the Internet to change and influence lives.</p>
