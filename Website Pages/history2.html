  <p>Once the Internet was turned loose on the public, and its global capability and potential became apparent, a power struggle emerged in its wake whose ripple effects can still be felt today. In the fledgling days of the World Wide Web, the two undergrads from the University of Illinois foresaw a future where the technology could be made more accessible to the average person, when it was still largely the realm of academic research. They created a piece of software with image and video capability that could be readily used and understood, the first graphical web browser, Mosaic. While a free project done and distributed by students in their spare time, it attracted attention and capital from Jim Clark, a former professor at Stanford who had made a name for himself in Silicon Valley as a tech entrepreneur. While initially unsure of how to monetize the project, the meteoric growth of Mosaic proved there was a market, and together they would found Netscape Communications.</p>
  <br>
  <p>At the same time, Microsoft, helmed by Bill Gates, had spent the last two decades monopolizing computer operating systems, seeking to maintain the company’s vise-like grip on the industry. They had a dream of their own, the Microsoft Network, or MSN, and saw the information superhighway as more of a toll road where they would come to collect. In 1993, when 90% of all home computers ran Windows, and Microsoft was the Goliath of the software world, it was a dream that was tantalizingly within reach. However, leadership at the company put their priorities elsewhere.</p>
  <br>
  <p>In October of 1994, Netscape’s first browser, Navigator, became publically available, and became an instant hit, spreading around the globe and putting the upstart company in Gates’ crosshairs. This breakthrough upended the power balance in the industry, and competitors began springing up to challenge Microsoft’s stranglehold on computing software. Gates himself would pen a memo to his employees describing the Web as the single most important advancement in computing since the PC, and a mission statement in which he sought to beat Netscape. </p>
  <br>
  <p>By 1995, Netscape was the gateway to the Web for millions of people, leading the charge in the so-called Browser Wars.  Microsoft was well known for their litigious tendencies almost as much as they had cases made against them, and the startup company grossly underestimated the threat they were up against. After a tense meeting where they rejected a buy-out offer from the software giant, Netscape began laying the groundwork for an anti-trust lawsuit. They would then go public with their stock, sending share prices through the roof and igniting a new gold rush in the tech world. The heads of Netscape publicly antagonized Gates and his company, as tensions mounted between the pair. In December of that year, Microsoft launched their own browser, Internet Explorer, as a direct competitor. </p>
  <br>
  <p>In that time, Netscape was synonymous with internet browsing much in the same way we think of Google today, and so there was real incentive on part of Microsoft put themselves into that conversation. As per at least one employee, their mission was to shut Netscape out entirely, and shove Internet Explorer down the throat of every customer. Microsoft reportedly approached different PC manufacturers, such as Compaq, to prevent them from installing Netscape on their hardware under threat of removing their Windows license. Little by little, the market share of Internet Explorer grew, while Netscape seemingly paid the price for their hubris. The final denouement came in the simple form of pricing structure: Netscape charged for its product to make revenue, while Microsoft could afford to bundle Internet Explorer for free with every version of Windows. By September of 1997, Microsoft had succeeded in landing 80 percent of all browser users with the release of IE 4.0, effectively ending the Browser Wars and once again cementing the company’s status as the first name in home computing. </p>
